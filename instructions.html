        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <h4>First, select the number of players for the game. Next, tap the “SHUFFLE & DEAL” button, and allow the website to create a hand for each player. The player with the “7-7” (or the highest double number) card plays first (clicks their card causing it to move the center of the screen). The player to the left of the person who plays first make the next play. This player MUST play a card that matches at least one number of ANY of the cards that have been previously played (in this case, a card with a “7”). The program will automatically place this card perpendicular (forming a “T”) to the first card played. Play then moves to the next player (and so on), who again MUST play a card that matches at least one number of ANY of the cards that have been previously played.</h4>
        <h1>Scoring</h1>
        <h4>The object of the game is to be the first player to reach 150 points. Points are awarded if the numbers on the ends of the cards (OUTSIDE NUMBERS) from ANY of the cards equal a multiple of 5. If a play is made that does not result in the numbers on the ends of the cards equalling a multiple of 5, play just moves to the next player. Each hand is over once one player plays his/her last card, at which time ALL OF THE REMAINING CARDS are awarded to this player. The nearest multiple of 5 of the sum of ALL of the numbers on each of these cards is added to this player’s score. The game will automatically reshuffle the cards and deal a new hand to each player. Play resumes with the player who played the last card playing ANY card to begin the next hand. Play continues until one player’s score reaches 150 points.</h4>
